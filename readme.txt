Aoi Tori is a simple WordPress plugin that allows you to show your Tweet's on your WordPress blog with very little fuss or effort.

== Description ==
Aoi Tori is the successor to Twitter Stream, a WordPress plugin I authored quite a long time ago. It is designed to add features I wanted to add back then, but didn't have the knowledge to implement.

= Main Features =

* Simpler oAuth Authentication with Twitter
* Custom built options page
* Widget or PHP function (shortcode coming soon)
* A small selection of built in display templates
* Roll your own template with ease
* Customize colors easily (on built in templates)
* Customize margins/paddings easily (on built in templates)

= Help =

If you need help please check out [Aoi Tori's documentation](https://nabesaka.github.io/aoi-tori) or you can contact me directly via [Return True](http://return-true.com). Finally you can report issues on the plugins issue tracker over on [Github](https://github.com/Nabesaka/aoi-tori).

Please do not report issues via the forum located here on WordPress as I use Github for my main version control and may not see any issues listed there.

== Installation ==
Install is simple via the WordPress admin. Just search for Aoi Tori. If you need manual instructions, look no further.

* Download the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory, or via the GitHub repo.
* Connect to your server using SFTP.
* Navigate to your WordPress plugins directory. If the zip you downloaded has a folder inside, upload the folder to the plugins directory. If it does not, create a folder called 'aoi-tori' and upload the contents of the zip into that folder.
* Login to the WordPress admin, go to plugins, and activate.
